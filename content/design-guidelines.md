## Tips and hints


- [ ] Use standard notation (UML) for technical designs


- [ ] Prefer well known design patterns but don't overdo it


- [ ] If a solution doesn't feel right, redesign or or backlog as engineering debt (never sacrifice simplicity and elegance, never tolerate low quality)


- [ ] A design is perfect when nothing more can be taken away, not when nothing can be added anymore 


- [ ] The technical design does not need to be complete, just complete enough to start coding 


## Design Patterns

Design Patterns are 'solution templates'. Using design patterns is considered  best practice in the industry as the design patterns are already tried and tested.
Common design patterns include:

- Singleton
- Factory
- Decorator
- Adapter
- Observer

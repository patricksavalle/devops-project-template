DevOps is compatible with many optimization methods. Often hybrid methods will work best, cherry-picking
elements from multiple methods. Optimization is an iterative process based on feedback or learning loops.
Establish the learning loop as early in the project as practical but no later than the MVP phase.

Incident management is not optimization. Optimizations are fed back to the planning process whereas incidents are handled immediately.  

Optimizations include:
- Refactorings to improve modularity or to better match functional modularity
- Improving performance
- Reduce resource usage
- Improving UX
- Removing slack, engineering debt or TODO's
- Redesign weak functionality

## Unified DevOps

- Build for observability (logging, tracing, monitoring)
- Explicitly define optimality, make deviations objective
- optimize only what can be measured or monitored
- continuously monitor and backlog sub-optimality 
- never sacrifice simplicity or elegance (if an optimization doesn't feel right, redesign the entire solution)

## LEAN

1. Eliminate waste
2. Building Quality In
3. Amplify Knowledge
4. Decide as late as possible
5. Deliver as fast as possible
6. Empower the team
7. Optimize the whole

## Kaizen

1. Good processes bring good results
2. Go see for yourself to grasp the current situation
3. Speak with data, manage by facts
4. Take action to contain and correct root causes of problems
5. Work as a team
6. Kaizen is everybodyâ€™s business
7. Make small changes over time

## Six Sigma DMAIC)

1. Define
2. Measure
3. Analyse
4. Improve
5. Control

# ISO/IEC 25010 Software Quality Model

Code quality frameworks describe code quality characteristics and their decomposition.
In [ISO/IEC 25010](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:25010:ed-1:v1:en), software quality is divided into two broad dimensions: 

## Product quality 
Product quality relates to the static and dynamic properties of the software proper. It is divided into 8 characteristics:
1. Functional Suitability
   - Completeness
   - Correctness
   - Appropriateness
1. Performance Efficiency
   - Time-behavior
   - Resource utilization
   - Capacity
1. Compatibility
   - Coexistence
   - Interoperability
1. Usability
   - Appropriateness recognisability
   - Learnability
   - Operability
   - User error protection
   - User interface aesthetics
   - Accessibility
1. Reliability
   - Maturity
   - Availability
   - Fault tolerance
   - Recoverability
1. Security
   - Confidentiality
   - Integrity
   - Non-repudiation
   - Accountability
   - Authenticity
1. Maintainability
   - Modularity
   - Reusability
   - Analyzability
   - Modifiability
   - Testability
1. Portability
   - Adaptability
   - Installability
   - Replaceability

## Quality in use
Quality in use relates to the outcome of human interaction with the software. It is divided in 5 characteristics:
1. Effectiveness
1. Efficiency
1. Satisfaction
    - Usefulness
    - Trust
    - Pleasure
    - Comfort
1. Freedom from risk
1. Context coverage

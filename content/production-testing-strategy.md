# Production Testing Strategy

Production testing is black box testing on production in order to find defects and bugs before they become problems.

**Production testing** is used to:
- identify defects before they become problems
- verify resilience under stress
- create temporary workarounds for defects that are not yet fixed

Production testing is **not** Testing-in-Production (TiP) which is part of the [acceptance testing](acceptance-testing-strategy.md).

Production testing is also not monitoring, it is actively provoking the production system into a response.

## Tips and hints

- [ ] Setup [monitoring](monitoring-strategy.md) first


- [ ] Have a [disaster recovery procedure](disaster-recovery-procedure.md) in place


- [ ] Have a [rollback or backup strategy](rollback-strategy.md) in place


- [ ] Beware not to expose vulnerabilities to the public


- [ ] Avoid degrading user experience


- [ ] Experiment with [chaos engineering](#chaos-engineering)


- [ ] Test experiments before running them in production

## Chaos engineering

Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the systemâ€™s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.
- Focus on the measurable output of a system
- Vary Real-world Events
- Prioritize events either by potential impact or estimated frequency
- Run Experiments in Production
- Automate Experiments to Run Continuously
- Minimize Blast Radius

Steps:
1. Hypothesize
2. Plan
3. Execute
4. Interpret
5. Improve

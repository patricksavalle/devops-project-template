**Production testing** is used to identify potential production problems before they happen and verify resilience under stress.
Production testing is **not** Testing-in-Production (TiP) which is part of the [acceptance testing](acceptance-testing-strategy.md).

Production testing is also not monitoring, it is actively provoking the production system into a response.

See:

## Tips and hints

- [ ] Only test what is being monitored

- [ ] Set up for chaos engineering in selected rings (latency, error-responses, time-outs, etc.)

## Chaos engineering

Chaos Engineering is the discipline of experimenting on a system in order to build confidence in the systemâ€™s capability to withstand turbulent conditions in production.
- Focus on the measurable output of a system
- Vary Real-world Events
- Prioritize events either by potential impact or estimated frequency
- Run Experiments in Production
- Automate Experiments to Run Continuously
- Minimize Blast Radius

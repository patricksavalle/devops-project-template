## TDD (test-driven)

In TDD developers write the test, and do this before they code the tested functionality.  
TDD methodology follows a very simple 6 step process:

1) Write a test case: Based on the requirements, write an automated test case.

2) Run all the test cases: Run these automated test cases on the currently developed code.

3) Develop the code for that test cases: If the test case fails, then, write the code to make that test-case work as expected.

4) Run test cases again: Run the test cases again and check if all the test cases developed so far are implemented.

5) Refactor your code: This is an optional step. However, itâ€™s important to refactor your code to make it more readable and reusable.

6) Repeat the steps 1- 5 for new test cases: Repeat the cycle for the other test cases until all the test cases are implemented

## BDD (behavioral-driven)
 

The process involved in BDD methodology also consists of 6 steps and is very similar to that of TDD.

1) Write the behavior of the application: The behavior of an application is written in simple English like language by the product owner or the business analysts or QAs.

2) Write the automated scripts: This simple English like language is then converted into programming tests.

3) Implement the functional code: The functional code underlying the behavior is then implemented.

4) Check if the behavior is successful: Run the behavior and see if it is successful. If successful, move to the next behavior otherwise fix the errors in the functional code to achieve the application behavior.

5) Refactor or organize code: Refactor or organize your code to make it more readable and re-usable.

6) Repeat the steps 1-5 for new behavior: Repeat the steps to implement more behaviors in your application.

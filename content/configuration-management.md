## Best practices

## IaC

Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)

## GitOps

GitOps is a way to do Kubernetes cluster management and application delivery.
GitOps works by using Git as a single source of truth for declarative infrastructure and applications.
It applies CI/CD (Continuous Integration/ Continuous Delivery) principles to configuration management.

- The entire system described declaratively
- The canonical desired system state versioned in Git
- Approved changes that can be automatically applied to the system
- Configuration agents ensure correctness and alert on divergence

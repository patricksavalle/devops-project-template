# Elon Musk's rules for efficient communication

Elon sent this to all Tesla employees in november 2022. **I added rule 0.**

> ## Rule 0: blameless communication
- Establish a culture of open, blameless communication
- Spend time solving problems not assigning blame
- Mistakes that become errors are manifestations of an underlying vulnerability in the systems and processes

> ## Rule 1: avoid large meetings 
- Large meetings waste valuable time and energy
- They discourage debate
- People are more guarded than open
- There’s not enough time for everyone to contribute 
- Don’t schedule large meetings unless you’re certain they provide value to everyone

> ## Rule 2: leave a meeting if you’re not contributing
- Your presence is useless iff a meeting doesn't require your 
  - input
  - value
  - decisions
- It’s not rude to leave a meeting but it’s rude to waste people’s time.

> ## Rule 3: forget the chain of command
   - Communicate with colleagues directly
   - Not through supervisors or managers
   - Fast communicators make fast decisions 
   - Fast decisions = competitive advantage

> ## Rule 4: Be clear, not clever
   - Avoid nonsense words and technical jargon as it slows down communication
   - Choose words that are:
     - Concise
     - To the point
     - Easy to understand 
   - Don’t sound smart. Be efficient.

> ## Rule 5: Ditch frequent meetings
   - There’s no better way to waste everyone’s time
   - Use meetings to:
     - Collaborate
     - Attack issues head-on
     - Solve urgent problems
       But once you resolve the issue, frequent meetings are no longer necessary
       You can resolve most issues without a meeting.
   - Instead of meetings:
     - Send a text
     - Send an email
     - Communicate on a discord or slack channel 
   - Don’t interrupt your team’s workflow if it’s unnecessary.

> ## Rule 6: Use common sense
   - If a company rule doesn't:
     - Make sense
     - Contribute to progress
     - Apply to your specific situation 
   - Don’t follow rules. Follow principles. Avoid following the rule with your eyes closed.
